<b>About Homology</b>
<p>What is Homology and Why Should You Care?

This site is dedicated to the discussion and distribution of information, images, and phylogenetic linkages of any type of attribute
possessed by "fishes" that is hypothesized to be homologous. We encourage contributions from world-wide researchers as this
is a community driven project that is free and will help to not only eductate but, as we hope, will aid in serving as a location for
researchers to come to not only examine various hypothezized homologous elements across diversity but engage in discussions

as to each of the structures and a community driven discussion as to the definition of homology at various levels.</p>


<p>So much of comparative biology rests on a foundational understanding via research as to what features of organisms are
hypothesized to be homologous and tested through phylogenetic analyses, this world wide resource will serve all of comparative

biologists - but for now only with the unnatural grouping commonly referred to as "fishes". As well known, Sarcopterygian fishes
are basal members of the lineage leading to tetrapods, we do hope to expand this to include any hypothesized homologous
features of tetrapds that can be linked across this clade (recent or fossil) and connect to the Sarcopterygians, and other "fish"
groups. Terminology of features or characteristics hypothesized to be homologous is different between gropus of vertebrates

and it is hoped that through individual anatomica, etc. feature common terms and abbreviations can be linked to better
understand the evolution of features in Vertebrata. </p>

<p>"Today, most biologists use the term homolog to denote comparable (similar or identical) characters shared through
common descent . . ."

<p>"The concept of homology is fundamental to the field of comparative biology. In 1843, Richard Owen defined homology
as "the same organ in different animals under every variety of form and function". Homology is evaluated strictly in an
evolutionary context. That is, organs in two species are homologous only if the same structure was present in their last
common ancestor. Organs as disparate as a bat's wing, a seal's flipper, a cat's limb and a human arm have a common
underlying anatomy which was present in their last common ancestor and so therefore are homologous as forelimbs.</p>

<p>It is important to distinguish between different hierarchical levels of homology in order to make informative biological
comparisons. In the above example, the bird and bat wings are analogous as wings, but homologous as forelimbs because
the organ served as a forearm (not a wing) in the last common ancestor of tetrapods. Homology can also be described at
the level of the gene. In genetics homology can refer to both the gene (DNA) and the corresponding protein product."</p>
