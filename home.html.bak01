<b>Welcome To Homology</b>
<p><b>What We Are:</b>

a community driven site for depositing images of different types of data that are
directly associated with specific taxa and discussions as to hypothesized homology between elements
across taxa.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Our Goals:</b> 
Here we hope that the anatomcal, functional anatomical, and systematic communities will engage in
providing their expertise in not only the theoretical issues surrounding the topic of homology but will
participate in aiding in standardization of names for features under discussion as well as their opinions
as to standardized abbreviations for features

<br>&nbsp;<br>

We also hope that users will contribute photographs, drawings, and any other images or movies that
will provide a database for users to compare features hypothesized to be homologous across taxa.
These contributions will provide a outstanding database for education and research and permit one to
compare features of all types to those at your research bench, in museums, or data collected in
previous studies.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Homology is only one of four components of this initiatieve to aid in biological and biodviersity research.
The other three include the following. Your account that you create provides you accesss to all of the other
linked components.
